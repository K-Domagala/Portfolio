                <p>Hi, I'm Krystian Domagala and I am an aspiring Full-Stack engineer. I am currently taking the Full-stack engineering course at codecademy as part of my IT career change traineeship program.</p>
                <p>So far, I was able to quickly advance through the first stages of the traineeship program by using all the skills I have aquired from studying my maths degree.</p>
                <p>Not going to lie, I am just amazing at everything I do, especially making up some text just to fill out a page while I test it's formatting, try out different styles and check it's compatability with mobile devices.</p>

                <article>This is one of the projects that I am most proud of; paying a lot of attention to small details such as ARIA and mobile device compatability.</article>

                <article>This is one of the projects i have done at university. I had to invent an algorithm to lower the amount of partitions within a database. This was a very primative program that was inefficient, but it was the very first useful program I have ever written with very little knowledge of Java.</article>
